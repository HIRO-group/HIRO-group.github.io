### Project Overview

Dryland ecosystems make up 40 percent of the global land surface and support nearly one-sixth
of the worldâ€™s population. Restorebot aims to develop robotics systems capable of restoring degraded grazing lands
We aim to have a robot independently identify sites of interest for restoration with shared autonomy capable of ingesting human knowledge to
assist in site selection.
