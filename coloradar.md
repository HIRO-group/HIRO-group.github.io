We present the **Onboard Illumination Visual-Inertial Odometry (OIVIO)**
dataset. It consists of 36 sequences, recorded in mines, tunnels, and other dark
environments, totaling more than 145 minutes of stereo camera video and IMU
data. In each sequence, the scene is illuminated by an onboard light of
approximately 1350, 4500, or 9000 lumens. We accommodate both direct and
indirect VIO methods by providing the geometric and photometric camera
calibrations. The full dataset, including sensor data, calibration sequences,
and evaluation scripts can be downloaded here.

### Downloads

We have organized our dataset using the Automous Systems Lab (ASL) dataset
format, though our dataset additionally provides files for the photometric
camera calibration and light calibration. Each sequence is available at
full-resolution and separated into its own tarball.

Use the provided
[script](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1Aak0eQJVv0itUu0BR7VC9fzK7XKhtpZP)
to down-sample the stereo images to a desired resolution. The script requires
the path to the downloaded (and extracted) sequence, output directory, and
desired image size. This script additionally updates the camera intrinsics
according to the new image resolution.

```
python downsample_asl.py --src path/to/TN_015_HH_01 --dst path/to/output --size 640x480
```

### Sensor Rig

We capture inertial data with LORD Microstrain 3DM-GX5-15 at 100Hz, and stereo
pair of 1280x720, grayscale images with a Intel RealSense D435i at 30Hz. Each
sequence in our benchmark is illuminated by an onboard, maximum 9000 lumens,
100W, white LED light. Using this sensor setup, as seen in the image below, we
attempt to capture the same trajectory three times, modulating the light's
intensity to approximately 100, 50, and 15 percent of its full capacity.

### Evaluation

This benchmark provides two methods for ground-truthing. The three sequences
where the ground-vehicle is used, 3D positions at 10Hz were captured via a
Leica TCRP1203 R300. In all remaining sequences, we start and end in the same
position, permitting the use of total accumulated drift as another evaluation
metric. We provide the following scripts for evaluation, adapted from the [TUM
benchmark tools](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/tools).

### Calibration

We additionally provide all calibration datasets, so that custom calibration
models may be inferred.&nbsp; The majority of the calibration sequences employ
the [Calibu](https://github.com/arpg/calibu) calibration target.
