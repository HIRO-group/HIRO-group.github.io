The setup guide walks you through installing libraries for the Sawyer robot...which is probably the first robot you'll interact with should you choose to get your hands dirty. Tutorial below is a condensed version of the [official guide](https://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/intera/Main_Page). Also, see [this page](https://rethinkrobotics.github.io/intera_sdk_docs/5.1.0/intera_interface/html/index.html) for Python API documentation.

## Setup

 1. Install Intera SDK dependencies â€” ROS is a generic framework for interacting with all sorts of robots. Intera refers to Sawyer's custom API.

    ~~~bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git-core python-argparse python-vcstools python-rosdep ros-melodic-control-msgs ros-melodic-joystick-drivers ros-melodic-xacro ros-melodic-tf2-ros ros-melodic-rviz ros-melodic-cv-bridge ros-melodic-actionlib ros-melodic-actionlib-msgs ros-melodic-dynamic-reconfigure ros-melodic-trajectory-msgs ros-melodic-rospy-message-converter
    ~~~

  2. Download Intera SDK and build.

    ~~~bash
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    wstool init .
    git clone https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/sawyer_robot.git
    wstool merge sawyer_robot/sawyer_robot.rosinstall
    wstool update

    source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash

    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin_make

    cp ~/catkin_ws/src/intera_sdk/intera.sh ~/catkin_ws

    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-moveit
    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-moveit-visual-tools
    ~~~

  3. Open `~/catkin_ws/intera.sh` in your favorite text editor (vim, duh!) and edit the following variables.

    ~~~bash
    your_ip="????"  # use ifconfig to find your IP address and copy it here
    ros_version="melodic"
    robot_hostname="hirosawyer.local"
    ~~~

## Tasks

Get something moving!

  * Run some of the example programs like the [wobble program](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/intera/Head_Movement_Example) on the Intera SDK Gazebo site for Sawyer.
  * Write a program that can move the Sawyer arm around in Gazebo. As an extension, create a basic menu system so that the user can send poses to the Sawyer.
  * Write a program that records the joint angles when the cuff button on the Sawyer arm is pressed--please get training from a graduate student before using the robot.
  With the recorded poses, after the user is done moving the arm, have the Sawyer arm reenact these poses in the order they occurred. You will need to limit the maximum speed of the arm as this can be dangerous.
  * Send an image to the Sawyer display.
  * add ik example

## 5. Example Code

  * Pan Sawyer's head.

      ~~~c
      #include "ros/ros.h"
      #include <iostream>
      #include <sstream>
      #include "HeadPanCommand.h"

      int main(int argc, char **argv)
      {
          ros::init(argc, argv, "pub");
          ros::NodeHandle n;

          ros::Publisher joint_pub = n.advertise<intera_core_msgs::HeadPanCommand>("/robot/head/command_head_pan", 100);

          ros::Rate loop_rate(1);
          float target = 1.0;

          while(ros::ok())
          {
              intera_core_msgs::HeadPanCommand msg;
              msg.target = 1.0 - target;
              target = msg.target;
              msg.speed_ratio = 0.5;
              msg.pan_mode = 0;
              joint_pub.publish(msg);
              ros::spinOnce();
              loop_rate.sleep();
          }
          return 0;
      }
      ~~~
  * Send a pose to Sawyer.
      ~~~c
      #include "ros/ros.h"
      #include <iostream>
      #include <sstream>
      #include "JointCommand.h"

      int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        ros::init(argc, argv, "pub");
        ros::NodeHandle n;

        ros::Publisher joint_pub = n.advertise<intera_core_msgs::JointCommand>("/robot/right_joint_position_controller/joints/right_j0_controller/command",100);
        ros::Rate loop_rate(1);

        float position = 2.0;
        intera_core_msgs::JointCommand msg;

        msg.mode = 1;
        msg.names[0] = "j0";
        msg.position[0] = position;

        joint_pub.publish(msg);
        ros::spinOnce();
        loop_rate.sleep();
        return 0;
       }
