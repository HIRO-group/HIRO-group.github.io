Robotics is an interdisciplinary research area so we're always looking to get people from different backgrounds involved. We only ask that you spend at least 10hrs per week in the lab -- any less and you probably won't get anything significant done. *So think about this when you're planning your time commitments for the semester.*

You don't have to work on weekends. Though there will be weeks when you work less than 10hrs, and some when you work more than that amount. Honestly, it doesn't matter how much time you spend as long as you're getting your work done. And of course, you can try working in the lab for a couple of weeks and if it's too overwhelming with classes and all, we won't force you to stay.

If you're a PhD student, jump straight to the [next steps](#next-steps) section of this tutorial. If you're an undergrad or Master's student, you need to do 3 things before you can become part of the HIRO lab:
 1. Fill out [this application](https://forms.gle/rDQzUZSr5ax8WMbS7) so we can get to know you a little better.
 2. Write code to move a dummy robot in *turtlesim* (see below!).
 3. Email <anuj.pasricha@colorado.edu> and set up a meeting to show him your final demo.

Before you do you first robotics task, you need to set up your development environment. It can get tedious at certain points but if you persist, you'll get to aid in the development of our future robot overlords. So keep at it! And ask for help. Early.

## Setting up your operating system
Most people in the lab use [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) for robotics development. Though [Pop!\_OS](https://system76.com/pop) (company based out of Denver!) is essentially built on top of Ubuntu 18.04 and is a much nicer-looking alternative AND comes with NVIDIA GPU drivers pre-installed (this will come in handy if you're working on training deep learning models; and, CUDA drivers are a pain to install). If you don't have an NVIDIA GPU in your machine, we have several lab machines that do. You can also dual-boot your own system with the regular version of Pop!\_OS (warning: you can accidentally wipe your hard drive if you haven't done this before), or use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run the OS from a virtual machine (quick and easy to setup). VirtualBox enables you to run the OS like any other app on your computer.

Hit *Download LTS* (right below the big *Download 19.10* button) on their main page. Ask for help if you don't know how to set up the OS, or at the very least, take a backup of your system before you venture into this territory.

## Setting up ROS
If you're working with robots, you need to learn how to use Robot Operating System ([ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Introduction)). Read the linked page to learn all about it! A majority of the code we write is in Python, but you can also use C++ when working with ROS. Make sure you test each bit of your code thoroughly. Make sure you commit to the lab Github often. And make sure you follow the [Google style guides](http://google.github.io/styleguide/) for the appropriate language.

Now, let's walk you through setting up ROS Melodic on your (virtual) machine. Note that ROS Melodic is only compatible with 18.04 LTS. copied from website and condensed...link

 1. Setup your computer to accept software from [packages.ros.org](http://packages.ros.org/).

	~~~bash
	sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
	~~~

 2. Setup your SSH keys.

	~~~bash
	sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
	~~~

 3. Install ROS.

	~~~bash
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full
	~~~

 4. Before you can use ROS, you will need to initialize rosdep. rosdep enables you to easily install system dependencies for source you want to compile and is required to run some core components in ROS.

	~~~bash
	sudo rosdep init
	rosdep update
	~~~

 5. Setup your environment — it's convenient if the ROS environment variables are automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched.

	~~~bash
	echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
	source ~/.bashrc
	~~~

 6. Other dependencies — Up to now you have installed what you need to run the core ROS packages. To create and manage your own ROS workspaces, there are various tools and requirements that are distributed separately. For example, rosinstall is a frequently used command-line tool that enables you to easily download many source trees for ROS packages with one command.

	~~~bash
	sudo apt install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
	~~~

 7. Create your development workspace.

	~~~bash
	mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
	source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
	cd ~/catkin_ws
	catkin_make
	~~~

At this point, you're ready to start learning about and using ROS.

* Familiarize yourself with [ROS terminology]({% post_url wiki/2018-04-18-ROS-concepts %}).
* Get your hands dirty with ROS through [*turtlesim*](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim/Tutorials) with these core tutorials.
	* Learn how to use [nodes](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes).
	* Learn how to use [topics](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics).
	* Write a [publisher](http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20broadcaster%20%28Python%29)
	* Write a [subscriber](http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20listener%20%28Python%29)

## Your mission, should you choose to accept it
Make the turtle in *turtlesim* move in an outward spiral.

## Next steps

The following is a list of things to do if you are new to the {{ site.title }}. Please consider this as a non-exhaustive cheat sheet that is modified over time. As such, feel free to edit it if there is anything you would like to add.

For _{{ site.meetings.semester }}_, we will be holding group meetings in **{{ site.meetings.location }}**{:.color-banner}. Feel free to stop by if you want to have a chat!

### Preliminaries

Prospective new members should do the following:
 1. Find a supervisor.
 2. Find a project.
 3. Communicate with [Prof. Alessandro Roncone](mailto:alessandro.roncone@colorado.edu) regarding your project.

Each lab member is required to keep a weekly work log. Contact **[Caleb Escobedo](mailto:caleb.escobedo@colorado.edu)**{:.color-banner} requesting access to our Google Sheets work log. Duplicate an existing tab in the worksheet and rename it. We will pull up this log at our weekly meeting and go over each member's tab.

#### Lab agreements

 1. Read carefully the lab agreements. There are currently three documents available:
    - [Lab etiquette](/docs/HIRO-Group-Lab-Etiquette.pdf), shared among all students and people working in the lab, with the rules of working in the lab
    - [Graduate student agreement](/docs/HIRO-Group-Grad-Agreement.pdf), slightly biased toward PhD students but to be used for all graduate students
    - [Undergraduate student agreement](/docs/HIRO-Group-UGrad-Agreement.pdf), for undergraduates

 2. Print them and be prepared to sign them at your next one-on-one meeting with Prof. Roncone. (This does not need to be done within 2 days.)

#### Lab access

 1. Write an email to **[Chantel Lehl](mailto:chantel.lehl@colorado.edu) with [Prof. Alessandro Roncone](mailto:alessandro.roncone@colorado.edu) and [Joewie Koh](mailto:joewie.koh@colorado.edu) in Cc**{:.color-banner}.

#### Mailing list

 1. [Subscribe to our mailing list!](https://lists.colorado.edu/sympa/subscribe/hiro-group)
 2. Click on the verification link sent to your email to complete your subscription.

### Optional steps

 1. To access research papers off-campus, set up the [CU Boulder VPN client](https://oit.colorado.edu/services/network-internet-services/vpn) on your machine. Alternatively, drag the following link to your bookmarks toolbar: [CU Proxy](javascript:void(location.href='https://colorado.idm.oclc.org/login?url='+location.href)). Whenever you come across a paywall, simply click on the bookmark to access the resource through the University Libraries proxy.
 2. If you plan to perform research with human subjects, please [be aware of the policies for doing so](https://www.colorado.edu/researchinnovation/irb) and [do the CITI training for Social Behavioral Research Investigators and Key Personnel](https://www.colorado.edu/researchinnovation/irb/getting-started/citi-training). [If your project requires IRB review](https://www.colorado.edu/researchinnovation/irb/getting-started/does-my-research-require-irb-review), please be prepared to do so on a timely manner as submitting an IRB Protocol [and having it reviewed] takes time.
 3. If you need storage for data, request an account with CU Boulder Research Computing on [this page](https://rcamp.rc.colorado.edu/accounts/account-request/create/verify/ucb). After receiving your RC account, await further instructions from RC to set up Duo two-factor authentication.
 4. If you are an undergraduate student joining for the summer, please [subscribe to this list](https://lists.colorado.edu/sympa/subscribe/cs-summer-undergrads).
