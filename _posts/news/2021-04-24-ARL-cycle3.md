Our proposal was selected for award within the [Army Research Lab's Strengthening Teamwork for Robust Operations in Novel Groups (STRONG)](https://www.arl.army.mil/strong/) Cycle 3 program.
The seedling funding ($100k) will allow us to perform preliminary work in the study of co-evolution of human and robot capabilities in collaborative scenarios. It will be led by [Yi-Shiuan Tung](https://yi-shiuan-tung.github.io/). 
Our team is excited to participate to the Innovation Summit that will be organized by the ARL during Summer 2022!
