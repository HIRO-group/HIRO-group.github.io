Today, we gathered outside of our laboratory to take the first ever group picture of the HIRO Group before some of our members leave for the summer or graduate.
As usual, it was a beautiful day, although some clouds have gathered around the top of the mountains. We'll do better next time :sunglasses:

Congratulations to **Sayali**{:.color-banner}, **Andrew**{:.color-banner}, **Anuj**{:.color-banner} and **Sean**{:.color-banner} for graduating!! It was great having you around and we wish you all the best in your future endeavours. Luckily for us, Sean will keep working with us over the Summer before starting his new position, and Anuj will join the PhD program in Fall 2019.
