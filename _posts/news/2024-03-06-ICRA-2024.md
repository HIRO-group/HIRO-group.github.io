Our work in using lazy propagation and collision checking techniques for faster kinodynamic motion planning has been accepted to ICRA 2024!

#### _The Virtues of Laziness: Multi-Query Kinodynamic Motion Planning with Lazy Methods_ by [Anuj Pasricha]({% post_url people/2019-10-13-anuj %}) and Alessandro Roncone

This publication introduces a multi-query approach to kinodynamic motion planning that takes advantage of lazy propagation and collision checking to outperform existing baselines in a number of key metrics.
