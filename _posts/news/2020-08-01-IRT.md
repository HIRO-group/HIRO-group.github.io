The College of Engineering and Applied Science has launched a new interdisciplinary research theme (IRT) in [Engineering Education and AI-Augmented Learning](https://www.colorado.edu/irt/engineering-education-ai/)! The scope of this theme is broad, combining research in engineering and computing education and assessment with artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing and robotics. Alessandro Roncone will serve as co-director of the IRT alongside [Angela Bielefeldt](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/bielefeldt/) from the Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering.

The mission of this IRT is three-fold:
 - Develop the theories, technologies, and know-how for advancing: 1) student-centered learning and next generation collaborative learning environments in K-16, graduate, and professional engineering and computing education, and 2) artificial intelligence technologies to support education and learning, most importantly in the areas of natural language understanding, multi-modal dialog management, reinforcement learning and robotics.
 - Serve as a national nexus point for empowering stakeholders with diverse identities and interests — researchers, educators, community members, and industry affiliates — to envision, co-create, critique, and apply student-AI teaming technologies in their classrooms and communities.
 - Grow a diverse workforce of future researchers, leaders, and practitioners at the convergence of engineering and computing education research and artificial intelligence research.

All interested faculty are welcome to join the team and are encouraged to contact either [Angela Bielefeldt](mailto:angela.bielefeldt@colorado.edu) or [Alessandro Roncone](mailto:alessandro.roncone@colorado.edu) for initial information, orientation and subscription to the mailing list.
