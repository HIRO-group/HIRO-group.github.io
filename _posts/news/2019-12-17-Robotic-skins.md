Our multidisciplinary collaboration with [Jianliang Xiao [Mechanical Engineering]](https://spot.colorado.edu/~jixi2362/), [Emiliano Dall'Anese [Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering]](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/dallanese/), and [Nikolaus Correll [Computer Science]](http://correll.cs.colorado.edu/) has been featured by the College of Engineering & Applied Science in an [article](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/2019/12/04/robotic-skin-could-transform-manufacturing-human-robot-interactions)!

The multi-functional artificial robotic skins that we are developing will improve the local sensing capabilities of robotics, paving the way to more natural human-robot interaction. This technology has the potential to radically transform how humans interact with robots, in contexts ranging from manufacturing to assistive robotics. We're excited to see that there's wider interest in this topic from our colleagues at the College!
