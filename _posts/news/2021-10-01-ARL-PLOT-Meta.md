The HIRO Group was selected for a $2M, 5-year award from the Army Reserach Laboratory titled *"Policy Learning for Optimal Teaming via TF-Conditioned Metalearning (PLOT-Meta)"*.
This work will be conducted in conjunction with our collaborators at the [Collaborative AI and Robotics Lab](http://cairo-lab.com/) led by another CU Boulder Robotics Faculty, Prof. Bradley Hayes.
We will investigate how true, synergistic collaboration can emerge from mutual understanding, and how adaptability and personalization of robot behavior will lead to fluent teams.
