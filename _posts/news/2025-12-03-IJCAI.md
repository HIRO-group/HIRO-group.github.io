My paper: "Implicitly Aligning Humans and Autonomous Agents through Shared Task Abstractions" was recently published to IJCAI 2025!

This work introduces a new method (HA²) that enables AI systems to use human-like task structures. Empirical results, including a human study, show that this induced structures allows AI teammates to coordinate more effectively with unfamiliar partners—both other AI systems and real people—and outperform all existing approaches.
