The National Science Foundation has awarded a $1.8M, 3yr grant titled: "RoboChemistry: Human-Robot Collaboration for the Future of Organic Synthesis" under the Future of Work at the Human Technology Frontier program.
This project, led by Carson Bruns from the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the ATLAS institute at CU Boulder, seeks to deply collaborative robots in organic chemistry laboratories, which are high-risk environments characterized by thousands of injuries every year.
Our goals with this project are: to augment and extend human capabilities; to provide both physical and cognitive assistance to chemists; to improve working and safety conditions.
