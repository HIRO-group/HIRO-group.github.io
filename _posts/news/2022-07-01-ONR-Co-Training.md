The HIRO group was selected for a $510k, 3-year award from the Office of Naval Research [ONR] titled ''*Humanâ€“Robot Co-Training: A Novel Paradigm for Symbiotic Humanâ€“Robot Collaboration*''.
This work will explore co-training, i.e. a paradigm in which the human and the robot are co-evolving fluency, synergy, and reliability over time in order for the team to be better than the sum of its parts.
It is the first step toward a broader vision where resilience, personalization, and human-robot dynamics are integrated into a fluid framework for a future where robots could serve as effective teammates to humans.
This will help advance our understanding of human behavior when coordinating and negotiating with robots.
