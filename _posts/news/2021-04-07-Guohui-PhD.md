We are thrilled to congratulate *Dr. Guohui Ding*{:.color-banner}, who successfully defended his PhD dissertation titled _"Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning as Applied to Autonomous Systems"_. Guohui's hard work has paid off, and the dissertation committee (composed of Lijun Chen, Alessandro Roncone, Christoffer Heckman, Sriram Sankaranarayanan, and Eric Frew) was happy to see his improvement over the years and his maturation toward research independence. Congratulations Dr. Ding!

​Guohui will move to Facebook over the Summer---we wish him every success in his future endeavors!
