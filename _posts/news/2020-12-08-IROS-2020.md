Congratulations to [Joewie]({{ site.url }}/joewie) and Guohui for their paper "Cooperative Control of Mobile Robots with Stackelberg Learning", which was published at IROS 2020!

The paper proposes Stackelberg Learning in Cooperative Control (SLiCC), a method for cooperative control of multi-agent systems in partially observable settings. SLiCC is based on an asymmetric prosocial–introspective cooperation framework that links state perception with agents’ decision-making strategies. This framework allows for agents to have different observation scopes, with prosocial and introspective behaviors assigned to agents based on the completeness of their state perception.
