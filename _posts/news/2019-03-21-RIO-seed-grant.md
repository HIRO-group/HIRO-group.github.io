Our proposal, whose title is _Programmable and reconfigurable soft robots for symbiotic soft/rigid robotic systems_, is a collaboration with [Jianliang Xiao [Mechanical Engineering]](https://spot.colorado.edu/~jixi2362/) and [Emiliano Dall'Anese [Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering]](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/dallanese/), and it has been selected as one of 25 most promising ideas out of 120 submissions. We are excited to start working on this project in Fall 2019!!
