Congratulations to [Caleb]({% post_url people/2019-10-10-caleb %}), Kandai, Matt, Mary, Ander and Krishna for their paper acceptance at IROS 2021!


#### _Contact Anticipation for Physical Human-Robot Interaction with Robotic Manipulators using Onboard Proximity Sensors_ by [Caleb Escobedo]({% post_url people/2019-10-10-caleb %}), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewhstrong/">Matthew Strong</a>, Mary West, Ander Aramburu, and Alessandro Roncone

This publication introduces dynamic contact thresholding, a method for contact anticipation during physical human-robot interaction in close proximity dynamic environments. Additionally, a framework is introduced that outlines object detection, prior to contact behavior, contact detection, and post contact behavior for a robot manipulator.


#### _Self-Contained Kinematic Calibration of a Novel Whole-Body Artificial Skin for Human-Robot Collaboration_ by Kandai Watanabe, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewhstrong/">Matthew Strong</a>, Mary West, [Caleb Escobedo]({% post_url people/2019-10-10-caleb %}), Ander Aramburu, Krishna Chaitanya, and Alessandro Roncone

The paper presents a kinematic calibration algorithm that can automatically locate sensors placed arbitrarily on the surface of a robot manipulator, given they are equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). To evaluate this calibration method and demonstrate potential applications, the HIRO group developed a stand-alone artificial skin unit equipped with an IMU and proximity sensor for object detection.
