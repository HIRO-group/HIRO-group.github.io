Weâ€™re excited to share that three HIRO Lab membersâ€”[**Gilberto Briscoe-Martinez**]({% post_url people/2023-11-15-gilberto %}), **Ava Abderezaei, and Jay Vakil**â€”have accepted internships for Summer 2025. These positions will allow them to apply their expertise in **robotics, AI, and machine learning** to real-world challenges while furthering their research in industry settings.

## Ava Abderezaei â€“ [Verdant Robotics](https://www.verdantrobotics.com/) (Machine Learning Intern)
{% include image.html url="people/ava.jpg" max-width="100%" description="Ava Abderezaei" %}  
Ava will be interning at **Verdant Robotics**, where she will contribute to **AI-powered agricultural robotics**. Her focus will be on:  

- **Developing machine learning solutions for real-time perception and decision-making**  
- **Improving robotic assessment of plant characteristics and adaptation to field conditions**  
- **Optimizing AI-driven automation for precision farming**  

Her research on **spill-free liquid transport in cluttered environments**, outlined in [*"Clutter-Aware Spill-Free Liquid Transport via Learned Dynamics"*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10802215) (IROS 2024), showcases her ability to apply **transformer-based learning models to dynamic robotic motion**. At Verdant, she will extend these skills to **enhancing robotic perception and control in agricultural settings**.  

## Gilberto Briscoe-Martinez â€“ [Plus One Robotics](https://www.plusonerobotics.com/) (R&D Intern)  
{% include image.html url="people/gilberto.jpg" max-width="100%" description="Gilberto Briscoe-Martinez" %}
Gilberto will be interning at **Plus One Robotics**, where he will work on integrating **machine learning and AI techniques into industrial robotics systems**. His role includes:  

- **Adapting academic ML models for real-world automation**  
- **Running large-scale experiments on cloud computing infrastructure**  
- **Developing AI-driven perception and control solutions for robotic systems**  

His prior research on **failure-active motion planning** and **diffusion-based trajectory generation**, presented in [*"Exploring How Non-Prehensile Manipulation Expands Capability in Robots Experiencing Multi-Joint Failure"*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10801883) (IROS 2024), directly aligns with this work. At Plus One Robotics, he will explore **AI-driven adaptability for logistics and warehouse automation**.  

## Jay Vakil â€“ **Stealth Startup** (AI Research Intern)
{% include image.html url="people/jay.jpg" max-width="100%" description="Jay Vakil" %}  
Jay will be interning at a **stealth startup**, where he will focus on developing **intelligent embodied AI agents**. His work will involve:  

- **Advancing foundational AI models for robotics**  
- **Exploring multi-task learning and AI reasoning in dynamic environments**  
- **Leveraging zero-shot learning for generalization across diverse tasks**  

His expertise in **generalist AI models and multi-modal learning** will play a key role in this work. This internship aligns closely with his Ph.D. research and will contribute to his goal of developing **versatile AI-driven robotic systems**.  

## ðŸŒŸ Looking Ahead  
These internships offer **valuable hands-on experience** and will allow Gilberto, Ava, and Jay to apply their research in practical settings while advancing the fields of **robotics, AI, and autonomous systems**. We look forward to seeing the impact of their work this summer!
