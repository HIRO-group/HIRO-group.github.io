Our case study proposal authored by [Kaleb](https://kalebishop.github.io/) and [Alessandro](https://alessandro.ronc.one/), along with Prof. Brad Hayes of CU's [CAIRO lab](http://cairo-lab.com/) was accepted into HRI 2021's Robots for Learning Workshop. This workshop was a great opportunity to discuss design considerations with other researchers doing great work in the field of robotic tutoring.

Our proposed case study will design and evaluate an interactive tutoring system that assesses early readers' grounded reading skills using proven embodied learning techniques, and adapatively generates practice problems for them to help develop these skills.
