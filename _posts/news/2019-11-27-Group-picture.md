For a number of reasons (mainly, people traveling and missing from the pictures), we took two different pictures for Fall 2019, none of them at the end of the semester. Luckily, the one in October was with snow :snowboarder::ski: whereas the one in November was with beautiful clouds :sunrise_over_mountains::cloud:--which is a testament of the extreme weather variability that Colorado is used to bestow upon us.
