Our proposal for a $20M, 5y NSF Institute on Student-AI Teaming [iSAT] was funded by the National Science Foundation! The project, led by [Sydney D'Mello [ICS and CS]](https://sites.google.com/site/sidneydmello/emotive-computing-lab), will bring together an interdisciplinary team composed of 29 faculty from 14 different research areas, and will focus on developing AI partners that augment teachers to do what they do best: inspire students.
