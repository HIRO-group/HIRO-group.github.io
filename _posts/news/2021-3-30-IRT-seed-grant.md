The College of Engineering and Applied Science's Interdisciplinary research theme (IRT) on [Engineering Education and AI-Augmented Learning](https://www.colorado.edu/irt/engineering-education-ai/) has awarded seed grant funding to a new project, **Towards equitable robot tutoring: an intersectional analysis of 
human-robot interaction in racially diverse classrooms.** This project is a collaboration between [Kaleb](https://kalebishop.github.io/) and [Alessandro](https://alessandro.ronc.one/) alongside [Prof. Tiera Tanksley](https://experts.colorado.edu/display/fisid_165976) of CU's School of Education.

This project aims to study racially minoritized students' interactions with educational robots and AI technologies, with the goal of developing a set of design considerations to help ensure that educational AI is designed alongside -- rather than _for_ -- students of color. We believe this approach will help create a future where educational AI is a tool for equity and inclusion in the classroom.
