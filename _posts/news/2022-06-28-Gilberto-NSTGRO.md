We are pleased to announce that *Gilberto Briscoe-Martinez* was awarded the [NSTGRO fellowship from NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/strg/nstgro)!
The GRO is a prestigious fellowship aimed at supporting NASA's mission to promote progress of science and advancement of knowledge in space technology; it is the first time in more than ten years that NASA awards this fellowship to a CS PhD student at CU Boulder.
Gilberto's project, titled ''*Enabling Long-term Robot Autonomy through Adaptable Fault Resilience*'', will investigate fault resilience in robotics, that is how to design robots that can cope with unexpected failures while continuing to fulfill their mission-critical tasks.
With this support from NASA, Gilberto will also work closely with scientists at NASA research centers, and will be given the opportunity to understand how to transfer his discoveries to real systems, and, eventually, see his research deployed in space.
If you'd like to know more, please [reach out to Gilberto](https://www.gbmartinez.com/), and take a look at [this spotlight article](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/2022/06/27/helping-robots-recover-failure-qa-nasa-graduate-fellowship-winner-gilberto-briscoe) on Gilberto's award.
