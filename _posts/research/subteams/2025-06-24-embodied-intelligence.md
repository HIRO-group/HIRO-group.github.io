# 1. Introduction

Our research is inspired by how **humans build intelligence through physical interaction**. We are guided by neuroscientific concepts like the _peripersonal space_ and _body schema_ representations, which evidence shows are central for humans to learn by experiencing the world through their bodies.

Despite incredible advancements in vision-language-action systems, robots today still lack the ability to truly generalize to complex environments. 
**We believe that true generalization requires grounding in sensorimotor experience**, where contact is treated not as failure but as a structured source of information, and where body morphology guides the selection of robust, adaptable strategies for interacting with the environment.

These strategies manifest in teaching robots to manipulate the world not just through grasping, but by maximizing their embodiment, i.e., using the full range of contact-rich, non-prehensile interactions that their bodies afford. By treating dynamics and collisions as central to interaction rather than as constraints to avoid, we enable robots to discover creative solutions that emerge from the interplay between their morphology, the physics of contact, and the structure of their environment.
