# 1. Introduction

Our research is inspired by how **humans build intelligence through physical interaction**. We are guided by neuroscientific concepts like the _peripersonal space_ and _body schema_ representations, which evidence shows are central for humans to learn by experiencing the world through their bodies.

Despite incredible advancements in vision-language-action systems, robots today still lack the ability to truly generalize to complex environments. 
**We believe that true generalization requires grounding in sensorimotor experience**, where contact is treated not as failure but as a structured source of information, and where body morphology guides the selection of robust, adaptable strategies for interacting with the environment.
