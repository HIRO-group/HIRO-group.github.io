# 1. Introduction

Our research is grounded in the insight that **human intelligence is deeply social**. We build on evidence from cognitive science and human factors research showing how humans coordinate through shared task models, implicit signals, and subtle behavioral cues, enabling them to align strategies and adapt seamlessly to one another.

Among all aspects of intelligence, **social intelligence remains the most elusive aspect of machine intelligence**. While robots have made strides in perception and manipulation, they still struggle to collaborate effectively with humans in dynamic, mixed-initiative settings. We believe that effective collaboration requires reasoning over shared abstractions, embedding human expectations into robot behavior, and generating predictable, legible interaction dynamics.
