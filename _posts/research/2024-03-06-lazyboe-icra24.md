_Abstract_: In this work, we introduce _LazyBoE_, a multi-query method for kinodynamic motion planning with forward propagation. This algorithm allows for the simultaneous exploration of a robot's state and control spaces, thereby enabling a wider suite of dynamic tasks in real-world applications. Our contributions are three-fold: i) a method for discretizing the state and control spaces to amortize planning times across multiple queries; ii) lazy approaches to collision checking and propagation of control sequences that decrease the cost of physics-based simulation; and iii) _LazyBoE_, a robust kinodynamic planner that leverages these two contributions to produce dynamically-feasible trajectories. The proposed framework not only reduces planning time but also increases success rate in comparison to previous approaches.
