# About Me

I work primarily on problems at the intersection of robotics and reinforcement learning. Currently, I'm pursuing several lines of research in robotic grasping and multi-robot systems. I'm also supervising an undergraduate project that seeks to leverage both verbal and visual context in the modeling of user intent. Before starting the doctoral program at CU Boulder, I worked at a Denver-based startup applying techniques from the latest NLP research to challenges in cybersecurity and legal informatics.

I spent the first two decades of my life in Singapore, but uprooted to the United States for college. In between these two places, I spent half a year living and studying in Russia following an edge-to-edge overland traversal of Europe. But I digress. Drawn to the mountains, I moved to Colorado after my graduation from Reed College. I've been here since.

Like almost everyone in Boulder, I enjoy running, hiking, snowboarding, and, well, bouldering.
