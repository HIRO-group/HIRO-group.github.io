# About Me

I am interested in leveraging AI to automate physical tasks, reduce work burden, and identify novel approaches to solving common problems. My research currently focuses on utilizing multi-agent reinforcement learning to enable robot-human collaboration. In addition to robot-human interaction, I am currently researching robotic tactile sensing methods that will enable robots to learn through touch. We hope that advancements in robotic skin will increased dexterity and safety in complex environments.

I lived in San Antonio, Texas until I started college at the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 2013. Due to unforeseen circumstances as an undergrad I withdrew for two semesters to have back surgery and work as a warehouse manager at UPS. After a year, I transferred to Trinity University in San Antonio where I finished my undergraduate degree in Computer Science.

In my spare time I enjoy playing board games, being outdoors, and spending time with family and friends. Iâ€™ve recently been searching for plants to furnish my house and office space on the weekends.
