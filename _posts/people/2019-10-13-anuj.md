# About Me

My research work is focused on robotic manipulation, specifically combining analytical and learned models to achieve human-level dexterity in nonprehensile skills such as poking, tilting, and tossing. I use a combination of machine learning and traditional motion planning along with simulation-based training to achieve this objective. The ultimate goal is to use this hybrid technique to generate a repository of skills that robots can then use to engage in more complex, affordance-informed task planning and manipulation.

I was born in India, grew up in Indonesia, and moved to the US for undergrad (UIUC). I then worked in robotics (San Jose, CA), 3D printing (Cambridge, MA), and mixed reality (Fort Lauderdale, FL) before moving to Boulder for grad school. I enjoy playing snooker, reading non-fiction, and watching Formula 1.
