# About Me

I work primarily on problems at the **intersection of robotics and reinforcement learning**{:.color-banner} (RL). 
Currently, I'm working on multi-agent RL for cooperative control of multi-robot systems.
I'm also interested in developing techniques for improving the sample efficiency of model-free RL, especially in the context of robot learning.
Before starting the doctoral program at CU Boulder, I worked at a Denver-based startup applying techniques from the latest research in natural language processing to challenges in cybersecurity and legal informatics.

I spent the first two decades of my life in Singapore, but uprooted to the United States for college.
In between these two places, I spent half a year living and studying in Russia following an edge-to-edge overland traversal of Europe.
But I digress.
Drawn to the mountains, I moved to Colorado after my graduation from Reed College.
I've been here since.

Like almost everyone in Boulder, I enjoy running, hiking, snowboarding, and, well, bouldering.
