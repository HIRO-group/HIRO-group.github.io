   project: Since joining ARPG in Fall 2019, I have been helping support the DARPA challenge team MARBLE through building mechanical systems. I have mostly been working alongside the other Research Assistants, and Dr. McGuire. The first project that I have been helping with is to design and build a system to stow, deploy and extend a set of radio beacons from some of the ground vehicles. It has been awesome to work with ARPG so far and I'm looking forward to see what comes in the future!

   project: Since joining ARPG and doing my independent study in 2020 Fall, I have been testing reinforcement learning approachs to controls for the Wave Adaptive Modular-Vessel(WAM-V) surface vehicle (USV). The project involves simulating water environments with realistic weather disturbances e.g. wind and waves to recreate similar conditions that a surface vehicle would experience on rough seas, while testing reinforcemnet learning controls for station-keeping.
