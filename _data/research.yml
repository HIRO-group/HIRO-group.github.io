 - project: Light source estimation
   img: /img/light_source_estimation.gif
   blurb: "This effort addresses the problem of determining the location, direction, intensity, and color of the illuminants in a given scene. The problem has a broad range of applications in augmented reality, robust robot perception, and general scene understanding. In our research, we model complex light interactions with a custom path-tracer, capturing the effects of both direct and indirect illumination. Using a physically-based light model not only improves our estimation of the light sources, but will play a critical role in future research in surface property estimation and geometry refinement, ultimately leading to more accurate and complete scene reconstruction systems."

   blurb: "This project aims to develop high fidelity real-time systems for perception, planning and control of agile vehicles in challenging terrain including jumps and loop-the-loops. The current research is focused on the local planning and control problem. Due to the difficulty of the maneuvers, the planning and control systems must consider the underlying physical model of the vehicle and terrain. This style of simulation-in-the-loop planning enables very accurate prediction and correction of the vehicle state, as well as the ability to learn precise attributes of the underlying physical model."

 - project: Referring Expressions for Object Localization
   blurb: "Understanding references to objects based on attributes, spatial relationships, and other descriptive language expands the capability of robots to locate unknown objects (zero-shot learning), find objects in cluttered scenes, and communicate uncertainty with human collaborators. We are collecting a new set of annotations, SUNspot, for the SUNRGB-d scene understanding dataset. Unlike other referring expression datasets, SUNspot will focus on graspable objects in interior scenes accompanied by the depth sensor data and full semantic segmentation from the SUNRGB-d dataset. Using SUNspot, we hope to develop a novel referring expressions system that will improve object localization for use in human-robot interaction."

 - project: "RAMFIS: Representations of Abstract Meaning for Information Synthesis"
   img: /img/RAMFIS_example.png
   blurb: "Humans can readily extract complex information from many different modalities, including spoken and written expressions and information from images and videos, and synthesize it into a coherent whole. This project aims to support automated synthesis of diverse multi-media information sources. // We are proposing a rich, multi-graph Common Semantic Representation (CSR) based on Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs) embellished with vision and language vector representations and temporal and causal relations between events, and supported by a rich ontology of event and entity types."

  - project: "RestoreBot: Autonomous Restoration and Revegetation of Degraded Ecosystems"
   img: /img/Husky-in-desert-Sep2021.jpg
   blurb: "In collaboration with the Correll Lab and the Aridlands Research Lab at CU Boulder, we aim to develop robotic multi-agent motion planning, join visual-tactile perception, and multimodal 3D map construction techniques to support targeted seed planting in degraded rangelands.//Dryland ecosystems make up 40 percent of the global land surface and support nearly one-sixth of the world's population. About 20 percent of the world's pastures have been degraded to some extent, leading to declines in a broad range of ecosystem services, ultimately threatening vulnerable communities. The RestoreBot project is applying developments in robotics and automation to reverse some of this degredation in the spirit of the UN's Decade of Restoration (https://www.decadeonrestoration.org). Our field work primarily takes place at the Canyonlands Research Center in southeastern Utah."
