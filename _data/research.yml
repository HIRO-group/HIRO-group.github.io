  - project: Multi Robot Communication Schemes
    img: /img/dep_mech_1.jpg
    blurb: "This project aims to develop a dynamic mesh network for difficult communication environments. Multi-agent exploration in such environments requires a software stack that is resilient to sudden mesh topology changes while carrying a wide range of data products. This requires a full stack implementation, including adapting single-robot communications solutions such as TCPROS to facilitate mesh-based multi-robot coordination and visualization of current network topology. Our approach allows prioritization of message transfer in a ROS environment, allowing large but not time-critical messages to be paused in order to transmit high-priority data."

  - project: "Mixed Reality With Field Robots for Emergency Response"
    blurb: "Collaborative human-robot field operations rely on timely decision-making and coordination, which can be challenging for heterogeneous teams operating in large-scale deployments. In this work, we present the design of an immersive, mixed reality (MR) interface to support sense-making and situational awareness based on the data collection capabilities of both human and robotic team members. We use a field robot to collect environment data and generate 3D reconstruction then display it in the head-mounted displays (HMD) along with the very large scale terrain. People can click a part of the terrain in an immersive environment and visualize the 3D reconstruction of some parts of the terrain. The figure shows the terrain of Boulder County and the point cloud above shows the 3D reconstruction of the blue trajectory on the terrain."

  - project: Light source estimation
    img: /img/light_source_estimation.gif
    blurb: "This effort addresses the problem of determining the location, direction, intensity, and color of the illuminants in a given scene. The problem has a broad range of applications in augmented reality, robust robot perception, and general scene understanding. In our research, we model complex light interactions with a custom path-tracer, capturing the effects of both direct and indirect illumination. Using a physically-based light model not only improves our estimation of the light sources, but will play a critical role in future research in surface property estimation and geometry refinement, ultimately leading to more accurate and complete scene reconstruction systems."

    blurb: "This project aims to develop high fidelity real-time systems for perception, planning and control of agile vehicles in challenging terrain including jumps and loop-the-loops. The current research is focused on the local planning and control problem. Due to the difficulty of the maneuvers, the planning and control systems must consider the underlying physical model of the vehicle and terrain. This style of simulation-in-the-loop planning enables very accurate prediction and correction of the vehicle state, as well as the ability to learn precise attributes of the underlying physical model."

  - project: Referring Expressions for Object Localization
    blurb: "Understanding references to objects based on attributes, spatial relationships, and other descriptive language expands the capability of robots to locate unknown objects (zero-shot learning), find objects in cluttered scenes, and communicate uncertainty with human collaborators. We are collecting a new set of annotations, SUNspot, for the SUNRGB-d scene understanding dataset. Unlike other referring expression datasets, SUNspot will focus on graspable objects in interior scenes accompanied by the depth sensor data and full semantic segmentation from the SUNRGB-d dataset. Using SUNspot, we hope to develop a novel referring expressions system that will improve object localization for use in human-robot interaction."

  - project: "RestoreBot: Autonomous Restoration and Revegetation of Degraded Ecosystems"
    img: /img/Husky-in-desert-Sep2021.jpg
    blurb: "In collaboration with the Correll Lab and the Aridlands Research Lab at CU Boulder, we aim to develop robotic multi-agent motion planning, join visual-tactile perception, and multimodal 3D map construction techniques to support targeted seed planting in degraded rangelands.//Dryland ecosystems make up 40 percent of the global land surface and support nearly one-sixth of the world's population. About 20 percent of the world's pastures have been degraded to some extent, leading to declines in a broad range of ecosystem services, ultimately threatening vulnerable communities. The RestoreBot project is applying developments in robotics and automation to reverse some of this degredation in the spirit of the UN's Decade of Restoration (https://www.decadeonrestoration.org). Our field work primarily takes place at the Canyonlands Research Center in southeastern Utah."
