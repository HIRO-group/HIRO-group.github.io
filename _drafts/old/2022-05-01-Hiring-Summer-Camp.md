## What is the robotics summer camp?
This one-week robotics summer camp for middle school students will take place at the Lafayette Library in June 2022. The camp participants will consist of eight to twelve middle school students. The students will attend a four-day training for three hours per day, and a final full-day competition to showcase the skills they have acquired. Each team will have a robot platform to work with. They will receive instructional material, content, and activities organized by Computer Science (CS) graduate students and research associates. The camp will be free to attend and will rely on volunteers and campus leaders.

Your role will be to help make this summer camp a reality. You will be working with organizers, children, and robots. You will be an indispensable part of the team. We also hope that you can attend the workshop in June and get to help out in person with the workshop. Likewise, if you are interested, you can lead the way to another robotics summer camp next year! We hope to make robotics a part of the community and this is the first small step to making that happen.

## What will be your day-to-day activities?
- Meeting with the main organizers of the program (Nataliya and Shiran)
- Designing and running small programs on the toy robot in JS and Blockly
- Sorting the programs into a curriculum that is accessible to middle school children
- Attending the summer camp to guide the children through the curriculum
