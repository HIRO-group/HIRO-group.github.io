At the HIRO Group, we perform research at the intersection _human-robot interaction_, _artificial intelligence_, and _robot control & planning_ with the goal of **developing robot technologies that enable close, natural, and extended cooperation with humans**.
Our research effort is divided in three, partially overlapping, tightly coupled subteams. They are highlighted below.
