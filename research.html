subtypes: [algorithmic hri and human-ai teaming, control and artificial skin,learning and modeling]

At the HIRO Group, we perform research at the intersection _human-robot interaction_, _artificial intelligence_, and _robot control & planning_ with the goal of **developing robot technologies that enable close, natural, and extended cooperation with humans**.
Our research effort is divided in three, partially overlapping, tightly coupled subteams. They are highlighted below.

## Control and Artificial Skin

In this subteam, we focus on ensuring that humans and robots can interact safely by simultaneously developing **novel sensing hardware** and **motion control frameworks**.
The hardware component of this project has led to the development of modular sensor units that can be positioned anywhere on the surface of a robot manipulator to gather information about the robot’s immediate surroundings.
Using the information provided by our sensor units, we have developed a control framework that allows robot manipulators to anticipate, detect, and react to external contact that could otherwise be harmful.

Our team aims to advance fundamental robot capabilities for future human-robot scenarios. 
We develop sophisticated robot technologies for human environments, and address challenges in: multimodal motion planning, long-term robot autonomy, non-prehensile manipulation, natural language grounding, and 
cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. 
Through these initiatives, we work towards bridging the gap between robotics and artificial intelligence, pushing the boundaries of robotic abilities to improve thir real-world usefulness.

The goal of this subteam is to create robot behaviors that promote safer, reliable, and effective interactions with humans.
We use an interdisciplinary approach, leveraging work from cognitive learning theory, cumulative prospect theory, social psychology, and experimental economics to conduct foundational research in human-robot interaction and collaboration.
