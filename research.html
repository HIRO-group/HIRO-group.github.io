At the HIRO Group, we perform research at the intersection _human-robot interaction_, _artificial intelligence_, and _robot control & planning_ with the goal of **developing robot technologies that enable close, natural, and extended cooperation with humans**.
Our research effort is divided in three, partially overlapping, tightly coupled subteams. They are highlighted below.


## Algorithmic and Social HRI

Point of Contact: [Kaleb Bishop](https://kalebishop.github.io/), Clare Lorhmann, Yi-Shiuan Tung

Substantial effort has been invested in expanding the role of robots into a multitude of new domains, from schools, to grocery stores, to warehouses.
But as robots are increasingly expected to work in close quarters or even interact with humans, the challenges in human-robot interaction have become more pronounced.
Behaviors that allow robots to engage with humans safely, efficiently, and smoothly are difficult to create, which is exacerbated by human perceptions of and responses to robots, which is itself still an open problem.

The goal of this subteam is to create robot behaviors that promote safer, more reliable, and more effective interactions with humans.
We use an interdisciplinary approach, leveraging work from cognitive learning theory, cumulative prospect theory, social psychology, and experimental economics to conduct foundational research in human-robot interaction and collaboration.

## Control and Artificial Skin

Point of Contact: [Caleb Escobedo]({{ site.url }}/caleb.html), Mary West

In this subteam, we focus on ensuring that humans and robots can interact safely in collaborative and cramped situations by simultaneously developing novel sensing hardware and motion control frameworks.
This work is interdisciplinary in nature; it requires expertise in computer science, electrical engineering, control systems, material science, and a multitude of other fields.
The HIRO Group’s research projects span across multiple research labs that are in constant communication.
These complementary technologies are used to elicit natural, fluid interactions that focus on human safety in the presence of robotic manipulators.
The hardware component of this project has led to the development of modular sensor units that can be placed anywhere on the surface of a robot manipulator to gather information about the robot’s immediate surroundings.
Using the information provided by our sensor units, we have developed a control framework that allows robot manipulators to anticipate, detect, and react to external contact that could otherwise be harmful.
Going forward, we plan to imbue robots with the ability to detect objects near and directly touching their surface with capacitive touch and tactile sensors.
These additional data streams and others to be included in future sensor units will allow for experimentation in nonverbal communication, object hand-off, and movement in clutter.

## Learning, Modeling, and Robotics

Point of Contact: [Joewie Koh]({{ site.url }}/joewie.html), [Anuj Pasricha]({{ site.url }}/anuj.html), Guohui Ding, Stéphane Aroca-Ouellette, Yi-Shiuan Tung

Our goal is to catalyze tangible and substantial improvements in robot capabilities, especially in human–robot scenarios, with research at the confluence of learning, modeling, and robotics.
We accomplish this from two perspectives:

 * In the first, we leverage recent advances in learning and modeling to develop sophisticated, accessible, and generalizable robot technologies.
 Our focus here is primarily directed toward robots that operate in human environments. The ability of robots to interact or even cooperate with humans are considerations that are often neglected in the learning and modeling communities.
 * Complementarily, we draw upon our expertise in robotics and human–robot interaction to inform foundational research in artificial intelligence---particularly in natural language processing and reinforcement learning.
 Our experience with real-world robotic systems allows us to underpin our research with strong empirical motivations, an approach that is conspicuously scant in much of the existing literature.
